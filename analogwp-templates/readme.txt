== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have containers activated in my Elementor site in order to use Style Kits? =
Ideally, yes. To take advantage of the new Style Kits pattern library you will need to activate the Elementor experiment at your website. If you still work with sections and columns though, you will still get access to the old library of Template Kits.

= Do I need Elementor PRO in order to use Style Kits? =
No, Style Kits will still work with the FREE version of Elementor. However, any patterns that include Elementor PRO widgets (Contact form, Call to action etc) will not be imported into your pages. The rest of the Style Kits functionality will work with the free version of Elementor.

= What is a Style Kit? =
In simple words, a Style Kit is a collection of your Global theme styles. Includes Typography, Colors, spacing and more. In Style Kits for Elementor you get access to a number of such theme style presets that you can import and apply on your website.

= Will the patterns work with my existing theme? =
Yes, if you have Elementor installed and activated. In general, patterns will inherit the styles of your existing theme (especially for typography). However it is recommended that you use Style Kits on a fresh site, and apply any of the included theme style presets as a starting point for your Global styles.
Using Elementor Hello theme is also recommended.

= Do I get support if I need help? =
We offer high-level support for all Style Kits users. Reach out to https://analogwp.com/support/ and submit a support request. Weâ€™ll get back to you asap.
